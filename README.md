# personal-webpage
Personal webpage as an assignment. I actually completely forgot about the rating criterias, but I hope this website still suffices.

## HTML
Basic HTML structure is present, 
There are clear content differentiation
and use of forms, links and media is present (Seen in the gallery tab).
Therefore, 3/5 is hopefully valid.

## CSS
Basic CSS styling is present,
Use of classes and ID's can be seen in all of the pages.
Responsive design is hopefully correctly implemented as well, example should be seen in the main page.
Flexbox and css interfaces should be seen in gallery and news pages.
Therefore 4/5 should be correct.

## JavaScript Basics
Simple interactions present (After completing survey, an alert pops up for example)
Multiple DOM and other event listeners are present in scripts (e.g. weather and time)
Some form of arrays can be found in weatherTime.js script, though objects and OOJ script principles are not present.
2/5

## Asynchronous Operations
Timers are not present, nor are AJAX or fetch.
Asynchronous calls being utilized can be seen in the news page (calling the News script, wwaiting for the response)
Error handling is implented where needed, mainly during calling scripts (weather, news, time)
I'm not sure if it's effective usage or not, therefore, 3/5
